/**
* Namespace: yootil.sound
*	Allows us to play a sound (doesn't use HTML 5 Audio)
*
*
* 	Didn't want to use a 3rd party library, they are too big for sometihng that won't 
*	get used that often by plugins.
*
*
* 	Ideally we would use HTML 5 Audio, however there is a cross domain policy.
* 	We can set access on the audio files, specifically Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
* 	See http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#access-control-allow-origin-response-hea
* 	for more information about Access-Control.
*
*
* 	But if other people use it, they would be forced to have a host that allowed
* 	them to set the origin (htaccess).  Too much trouble for now.
